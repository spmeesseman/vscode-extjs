Diagnostics:

	☐ dot notation.  pretty much same validation as for requires[] but diff in code blocks (warning vs. error)
	☐ packages not @sencha should have xtype validation.  currently not validated if namespace name begins w Ext
	☐ (warning) for deprecated property/config/method/class use
	✔ Requires - marks onvalid when a class reference is to an alternateClassName @done(21-08-13 15:33)
		e.g. App.model.user.User as alternate but namespace sees App.model.User
	☐ Method parameter validation against types in jsdoc

JsDoc:

	☐ If jsdoc isn't present for an overridden method, then check for parent method jsdoc
	☐ Handle the @inheritdoc tag
	☐ Handle links

Intellisense:

	☐ xtype intellisense is displaying outside of blocks, i.e. comments
	☐ xtype selection is double printing xtype if already typed in and into the string part
	✔ Add mixin config to syntax tree parsing @done(21-08-13 14:35)
		Process as an extended class for properties/configs/methods
	☐ When writing method parameters, and they are line broken (i.e. object param), method signature breaks
	✔ Inline does not work when preceded by 'await ' (or probably any other word) @done(21-08-13 17:08)
	☐ Main namespace inline does not work.  e.g. 'Ext', or 'VSCodeExtJS', 'GEMS'
	☐ For instance properties, the 'go to definition' should go to the declaration, not the definition
		the 'go to type definition' works as intended and goes to the definition
	☐ The 'this' property needs to check for function scope, currently 'this' is always the main cmp instance
	☐ dot completion - doesnt work if there are characters to the right
		e.g.: app.js line 85, remove 'PhysicianDropdown' and try typing it in again
		it will only work if the typing is coming left to right and there are no chars to the right

Miscellaneous:

	✔ add 'clear ast cache' or 'reindex' task for chance becomes corrupt @done(21-08-08 14:15)
	☐ goto definition for jsdoc parameter types (surrounded with{})
	☐ Configs and variable level cache mappings need to be separated by a 3rd dimension (currently only project and namespace) @high
		Separate again using component class name
	✔ Indexing should disable when opening an ExtJs file but the project has not been indexed (no .extjsrc or app.json) @done(21-08-13 16:52)

Stores:

	☐ AST parsing (property 'type' and mappings)
	☐ diagnostics for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ completion for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ go to definition for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ go to type definition for 'type' same as 'xtype'
