Diagnostics:

	☐ dot notation.  pretty much same validation as for requires[] but diff in code blocks (warning vs. error)
	☐ packages not @sencha should have xtype validation.  currently not validated if namespace name begins w Ext
	☐ (warning) for deprecated property/config/method/class use
	☐ Requires - marks onvalid when a class reference is to an alternateClassName
	☐ Method parameter validation against types in jsdoc

JsDoc:

	☐ If jsdoc isn't present for an overridden method, then check for parent method jsdoc
	☐ Handle the @inheritdoc tag
	☐ Handle links

Intellisense:

	☐ xtype intellisense is displaying outside of blocks, i.e. comments
	☐ Add mixin config to syntax tree parsing
		Process as an extended class for properties/configs/methods
	☐ When writing method parameters, and they are line broken (i.e. object param), method signature breaks
	☐ Inline does not work when preceded by 'await ' (or probably any other word)

Miscellaneous:

	✔ add 'clear ast cache' or 'reindex' task for chance becomes corrupt @done(21-08-08 14:15)
	☐ goto definition for jsdoc parameter types (surrounded with{})
	☐ Configs and variable level cache mappings need to be separated by a 3rd dimension (currently only project and namespace) @high
		Separate again using component class name

Stores:

	☐ AST parsing (property 'type' and mappings)
	☐ diagnostics for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ completion for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ go to definition for 'type' same as 'xtype'
	☐ go to type definition for 'type' same as 'xtype'
