AST Parser:

	✔ Store property 'type' and mappings @done(21-08-21 09:22)
	☐ Additional properties needed for models

Completion:

	✔ xtype cmopletion is displaying outside of blocks, i.e. comments @done(21-08-20 23:51)
	✔ xtype selection is double printing xtype if already typed in and into the string part @done(21-08-15 19:17)
	✔ Add mixin config to syntax tree parsing @done(21-08-13 14:35)
		Process as an extended class for properties/configs/methods
	☐ When writing method parameters, and they are line broken (i.e. object param), method signature breaks
	✔ Inline does not work when preceded by 'await ' (or probably any other word) @done(21-08-13 17:08)
	✔ Main namespace inline does not work.  e.g. 'Ext', or 'VSCodeExtJS', 'GEMS' @done(21-08-17 23:44)
	✔ For instance properties, the 'go to definition' should go to the declaration, not the definition @done(21-08-21 08:55)
		the 'go to type definition' works as intended and goes to the definition
	☐ The 'this' property needs to check for function scope, currently 'this' is always the main cmp instance
	✔ dot completion - doesnt work if there are characters to the right @done(21-08-21 08:53)
		e.g.: app.js line 85, remove some of 'PhysicianDropdown' and try typing it in again
		it will only work if the typing is coming left to right and there are no chars to the right
		remove it to the left dot, then it gives instance components.  fix weird things here.
	✔ Instance properties should not show when the class name is typed @done(21-08-21 08:54)
		i.e. "VSCodeExtJS." should not display "testFn" unless it was a singleton or the method was in a 'statics' block
	✔ Implement 'singleton' - display on classname typing, not instance @done(21-08-21 08:54)
	✔ Implement 'statics' block - display on classname typing, not instance @done(21-08-18 20:35)
	✔ Completion for store 'type' same as 'xtype' @done(21-08-21 14:19)
	☐ Should work for a string in a requires/uses/models/stores block should display the doc for that class
	☐ Static create() for stores/models/? @started(21-08-29 16:04)
	✔ The 'privates' block should be applied to instance components @done(21-08-21 03:51)
		object completion showing model fields as opposed to properties/configs
	☐ Snippet completion, i.e. sorte... and the completion item would be the entire sorter object
		sorters: [{
			property: "",
			direction: "ASC"
		}]
		And place cursor into property value quotes. Can do for store filters, sorters, model fields, etc
		Configurable template file?
	✔ Models.  And the special config applied to 'fields'. @done(21-09-04 13:18)
	☐ Model property getter/setter when using associations
	☐ Component store property string literal completion, like xtype/type
	☐ Store model property string literal completion, like xtype/type
	☐ Apply defaults for 'items'
		look for xtype and apply same logic as if it was in item object itself
	☐ Grid columns, column config
	✔ Statics on main app inline. @done(21-09-06 15:51)
		i.e. GEMS.user.  'user' properties do not have completion
		Scan for GEMS.user= in alll files?  Or create static file mapping to types (like eslint globals)
	☐ Main app inline
		i.e. GEMS.model, GEMS.store, 'model', 'store' completion does not show any items
	✔ Highlight a word in a comment, type x, and the xtype completion items appear. @done(21-09-04 13:19)
		behind comments no completion should happen
	☐ Ext.Ajax.* does not work
		Probably more singletons likes this don't work too
		Ajax is in completion list after Ext., but nothing with Ext.Ajax.
	✔ after = inline class doesnt work @done(21-09-12 20:56)
		VSCodeExtJSApp.user = VSCodeExtApp.model.user.User
		no completion after the '=' sign
	✔ In comments still firing in some places @done(21-09-12 20:46)
	    /**
	     * @param {Ext.container} remove If `true`, removes...... [getting completion here]
		 */
	✔ Local instance vars with multiple down/up/prev/next @done(21-09-11 18:44)
		e.g. const asrButton = view.up('app-main').down('asrbutton');
		typing asrButton. shows nothing
	☐ Private methods and properties should show in the file that defines them even if 'show private' setting is off

Definition:

	✔ Store - go to definition for 'type' same as 'xtype' @done(21-08-21 18:54)
	☐ Models
	☐ Children of alias do not work
		e.g. AppUtils.GridColumn
	☐ Local instance vars with multiple down/up/prev/next
		e.g. const asrButton = view.up('app-main').down('asrbutton');
		no definition found for asrButton

Diagnostics:

	☐ dot notation.  pretty much same validation as for requires[] but diff in code blocks (warning vs. error)
	✔ 'uses' property.  same validation as for requires[] @done(21-08-15 18:46)
	☐ packages not @sencha should have xtype validation.  currently not validated if namespace name begins w Ext
	☐ (warning) for deprecated property/config/method/class use
		configuration setting - on/off
	✔ Requires - marks onvalid when a class reference is to an alternateClassName @done(21-08-13 15:33)
		e.g. App.model.user.User as alternate but namespace sees App.model.User
	☐ Method parameter validation against types in jsdoc
	✔ Store diagnostics for 'type' same as 'xtype' @done(21-08-22 00:01)
	☐ The 'models' and 'stores' property in Application.js should be validated like 'requires' and 'uses'
	☐ the 'uses' validation should have separate error code from 'requires'
	✔ 'mixins' property.  same validation as for requires[] and uses[].  separate error code. (see above too) @done(21-08-26 14:08)
	✔ Store - for 'model' field @done(21-08-26 14:08)
	✔ The 'type' property is not validated right if not a store, i.e. 'layout' config "type: 'vbox'" @done(21-08-26 14:08)
		map type aliases i.e. 'store.', 'layout.', etc
	✔ Model fields @done(21-08-31 22:41)
		for object param to create() and new
	☐ Invalidate inline Ext.define in controller files
		configuration setting - on/off
	☐ Invalidate requires for .create
		VSCodeExtJSApp.user = VSCodeExtApp.model.user.User.create(...)
		Checkrequires array for VSCodeExtApp.model.user.User
		configuration setting - on/off
	✔ Model reference {} object - 'type' field is showing invalid @done(21-08-26 18:11)
	✔ Model fields 'type' i.e. 'string' is getting validated and showing as no reference found @done(21-08-25 23:07)
		make an 'ignoreTypes' srray setting, include 'string', 'number', etc, and user can add to list
	☐ Store types are invalidated if they are not in 'store' or viewModel 'stores'
		e.g. SettingsWinModel.js this.setStores()
	☐ Action to ignore additional 'type' fields
		should reference parent object - can leave types on for stores, etc, but turn off for other parent obj
	☐ Add grid 'filter' type to validation
		Grid filter usees 'type' to reference stores in some cases e.g. User Mgmt grid.js filter: { type: 'yesno' ... }
	✔ Deeply nested store types still invalidate @done(21-09-01 00:45)
		e.g. User Mgmt AppUtilities.js line 6978
	☐ Invalidate improper static/private call.
		e.g. private call only on instances, static calls only on full classpath names or alternateClassNames
	☐ Ensure require should examine requires block up the inheritance tree, and up reference tree
		each requires should read the requires for that defined component, and up
	✔ extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController' is invalidated @done(21-09-04 13:20)

JsDoc:

	☐ If jsdoc isn't present for an overridden method, then check for parent method jsdoc
	☐ Handle the @inheritdoc tag
	☐ Handle links
	☐ Make type doc line class part a link
		i.e. 'class component: Ext.Component', make Ext.Component a gotto def link 
	☐ Hovering over a string in a requires/uses/models/stores block should display the doc for that class
		GoTo Def does.
	✔ Main parsed hover markdown needs reformatting @done(21-08-29 15:41)
		commentParser.js
		Put type header in parser instead of adding separately in completion provider
		Format and remove all @ markers
	☐ Object properties
		e.g., xtype: 'viewtoolbar', noRemoteActions: true, ....' ... show doc for all ocnfigs/props like noRemoteActions
	✔ Method doc needs work @done(21-09-05 11:25)
		title line should contain params
		i think doc is better in one spot than the other, i.e. completion vs.hover, cant remember
	☐ Local instance vars with multiple down/up/prev/next
		e.g. const asrButton = view.up('app-main').down('asrbutton');
		hover over asrButton anywhere in the function shows nothing
	☐ Multi-type tag does not get parsed, i.e. {Boolean|String}, parameter is missing in doc

Miscellaneous:

	☐ Server module nyc instrumentation
	☐ Server cannot break on common module code (ts) while debugging
	Move as much functionality to server side as possible:
		✔ JsDoc parser @done(21-08-29 11:52)
		☐ Hover?
		☐ Completion?
		need to step into js code from calling ts server code
	✔ Fault tolerance in AST parser @done(21-08-28 13:26)
	✔ add 'clear ast cache' or 'reindex' task for chance becomes corrupt @done(21-08-08 14:15)
	☐ goto definition for jsdoc parameter types (surrounded with{})
	✔ Configs and variable level cache mappings need to be separated by a 3rd project dimension @high @done(21-08-23 16:00)
		Separate again using project name (workspace dir name)
		currently only [namespace][componentname].  needs to be [project][namespace][componentname]
	✔ Indexing should disable when opening an ExtJs file but the project has not been indexed (no .extjsrc or app.json) @done(21-08-13 16:52)
	✔ When workspace opens, should be able to detect files that have been modified outside the env and re-index @done(21-09-04 00:17)
	✘ FS cache - check to see if can get away with not persisting object range info @cancelled(21-08-29 07:17)
		i think this is only used on the active document, which is always re-indexed anyway when opened
	✔ Namespace can be removed from mapping references throughout code @done(21-08-26 18:12)
	☐ Packages referenced from app.json should have own cache location
		use pkg namespace name extracted from pacage.json in pkg dir
		currently get stored in main app namespace storage file
	✔ Object ranges don't have to persist to cache. @done(21-08-28 10:24)
		Can be parsed for active document only (I think).
		remove todo comment in the code
	☐ Max doc size for parsing.  configurable
	✔ Add 'framework' property to extjsrc file @done(21-08-28 10:24)
		so can reference a framework per project, located somewhere outside of project, no app.json
		same as setting multiple paths in classpath in array but will keep separate in storage, better perf
	☐ Aliases should not be added to xtypes for widget scraping now that all is implemented
		syntaxTree.js parseClassDef
	✔ Renamed/moved file doesnt get cached.  validates, but no hover, completion, etc @done(21-08-28 10:24)
	☐ if a doc is edited, closed w/o saving, mem cache needs to be reset @high
		fs cache will hold previous value still, since no persist until save
	☐ Review namespace usage
		is it correct to use 'name' property from app.json
		namespace property in package.json files sencha cfg
		namespace property in sass ad other app.json cfg objects
	☐ Support post Cmd6.7+ projects with npm installed ext-core
	☐ Cmd project package.json
		subfolders property, refernces to all cmd packages
	☐ Manual instance mapping
		e.g. configuration setting to treat all instances of App.facility as App.model.facility.Facility
	☐ 'fix requires' ifno requires array exists
		it is created correctly, but is tabbed over twoce instead of once

Signature:

	☐ Static create() for stores/models/?
	☐ DataUtils.ajaxRequest no signature
		Other DataUtils.*?

Task View:
	
	✔ Shell @done(21-08-29 10:22)
	☐ ExtJs code snippets
		e.g. an Ext.create('Ext.util.DelayedTask', {...
	☐ create Ext.define file from template
		Prompt for dir/filename, or add to open empty document
	☐ map to shortcut keys setting

Type Definition:

	✔ go to type definition for 'type' same as 'xtype' @done(21-08-21 18:54)
	☐ Models
