	Differentiate between static/singleton methods/props vs. instance
	Will need to parse Ext.create()s, new, and static.create()

☐ Class Validation
	Match class parts, check for invalid parts
	Example:
		Ext.csi.store.Base
	"stor" should receive error invalidation, since it should be "store"

☐ Deprecation Validation
	Should receive warning invalidation
	Example:
		Ext.csi.store.Base.timeout
	If "timeout" is tagged with @deprectaed in the comments, then warning underling
	Add formatted hover markdown for all methods/properties when deprecated

☐ Bug - Function/method/property names of the same name get overwritten in the mappings
        If exist in more than one class
		Mappings at prop/config/method level need to be mapped at a lower level
		Knew that was coming, saw it when i looked at the original extension used to
		start this project
